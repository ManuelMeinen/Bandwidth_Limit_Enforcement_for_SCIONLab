This bachelor thesis project discusses the design, implementation and evaluation of an automated mechanism that enforces an upper bandwidth limit for the \ac{SCIONLab} network infrastructure.
\\
The upper bandwidth limits are enforced on \acs{SCIONLab}'s \aclp{AP} and hold for both ingress as well as egress traffic between the \ac{AP} and the user-\ac{AS}.
\\
The backbone of this automated mechanism is implemented in Python, using the \ac{TC} tool of the iproute2 utility package.
\\
The effectiveness of the implementation is evaluated using iPerf3, an open-source network performance measuring tool.
