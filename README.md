# Bandwidth Limit Enforcement for SCIONLab
## Abstract
This bachelor thesis project discusses the design, implementation and evaluation of an automated mechanism that enforces an upper bandwidth limit for the SCIONLab network infrastructure.  
The upper bandwidth limits are enforced on SCIONLabâ€™s Attachment Points and hold for both ingress as well as egress traffic between the
AP and the user-AS.  
The backbone of this automated mechanism is implemented in Python, using the TC utility of the iproute2 utility package.  
The effectiveness of the implementation is evaluated using iPerf3, an open-source network performance measurement tool.
